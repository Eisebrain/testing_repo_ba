# Instructions for Completing the Tasks

1. **Fill out the Survey about yourself (Forms/Word)**

2. **Your task is to search for Vulnerabilities in source code. Before starting:**
    - a. Please track your time and provide it afterwards in the “NASA TLX” file.
    - b. Spend a maximum of 20 minutes analysing the repository.
    - c. Please don't use ChatGPT or Google to check how a specific vulnerability could look like. Only use the explanations provided in the vulnerabilities.md
    - d. Download detected_vulnerabilities.xlsx and open it.
    - e. Download “NASA TLX” (fill out after your task)

3. **Now it gets practical:**
    - a. You’re going to analyse the files 1-4 of this folder, one after the other.
    - b. You have to search for the vulnerabilities explained in vulnerabilities.md in these files.
    - c. When you think you found a vulnerability, provide the name, the line(s) of code regarding the vulnerability and a short description in                 detected_vulnerabilities.xlsx
    - d. Whenever you’re set up and ready, start the timer. If you think you found every vulnerability, stop the timer earlier.

4. **After analysing the files**
    - a. Fill out the “NASA TLX” and provide the time needed.
    - b. Send me the “NASA TLX” file and detected_vulnerabilities.xlsx via Email (mick.eisebraun@de.bosch.com)
